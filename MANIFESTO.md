# Hyper iOS Manifesto

## Introduction 
This document is intended to describe the current situation, the caveats, why it is important and the end goal.

## Disclaimer
This concerns the iOS team and is based on the current team size and setup. This is not set in stone and is prone to change depending on team size and future direction.

## Current
Currently our setup is based on people being allocated 100% on a project, from start to finish, as long as there is work to do. Being a small team and delivering small to medium applications, this results in one developer per project. From a project managers perspective, this is called a resource. Allocating and reusing the same resource through-out the project is essential for the projects overall success.

## Caveats
By allocating only one person per project, we are effectively reducing the chances and incentive to collaborate with other developers. We also limit ourselves to not being able to tackle more projects than the team size. Project size == Amount or projects (4 developers -> 4 projects).

The role for the developer becomes polymorphic, going from resource to becoming a technical dependency, that is hard to replace.
Grounds for replacing a resource in a project can be a multitude of reasons, some are planned, others are accidental.

Giving the developer lead ownership over a project can also cause a conflict of interest, his or her project will always be prioritized over other ongoing projects, it is a major factor in decrease of collaboration.

We also tend to run into the situation where we have an uneven workload, one person is working overtime while the other person has 25% to 0% customer time.

## A new kind of lead
The lead role for an iOS developer will have to change, he or she, would have some unique expectations in what goes into his or her performance. A lead will attend meetings, be reasonable for passing on knowledge to their fellow developers, flag when a project is in need of help, holds the main incentive for collaboration and that the new convention are implemented properly. He or she will also be the main resource for designers to spar with.

The lead will always set up and configure the core setup for the new project.

## Things we can avoid
With this setup, we are no longer dependent on the individual as the responsibility is now shared among all the members of the team. The teams core foundation going forward revolves around collaboration and playing on people's strengths

If a resource is replaced, we can avoid core knowledge being lost in the transition. External disruption, such as sickness, parental leave and leave of absence can be handled within the team and will be less costly and prone to halt or delay project progression.

This will also even the workload, we would no longer find us in situations where one resource is working up-to 100% or more and the other barely has any customer time.

With collaboration comes team spirit, something up-lifting and prone to generate high fives. The human touch that takes applications from good to great. And when we do things together, we learn together and grow together.

## Practicality 

- [ ] Everyone needs access to projects in Harvest, this will be done gradually when the opportunity arrives.
- [ ] The team will sync every Thursday to go through the current workload and plan the upcoming week. The sprints will be written down and stored on Box.
- [ ] Every week, each team member will do a small write up about the projects weekly sprint. (We are not tied to one week project sprints but team sprints should be done on a weekly basis).
- [ ] Before every resource meeting, the team will touchdown on where we are, where we need to go and report the capacity for the coming week.
- [ ] The lead for the team will own the project in Harvest, this is the person that you will book for the duration of the project.
